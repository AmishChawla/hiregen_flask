# Application Tracking System (ATS)

Hiregen.com features a robust Application Tracking System (ATS) designed to help employers efficiently manage and track candidates throughout the hiring process. The ATS provides a visual and intuitive interface, making it easy to monitor candidate progress, schedule interviews, and make informed hiring decisions.

## Kanban View for Candidate Progress

The ATS utilizes a Kanban-style board to represent each stage of the recruitment pipeline, such as "Applied", "Screening", "Interview", "Offer", and "Hired". Employers can drag and drop candidates between stages, providing a clear overview of where each applicant stands in the process.
