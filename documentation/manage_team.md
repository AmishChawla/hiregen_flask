# Manage Teams

Hiregen.com allows each employer to create and manage their own team of sub-users, making collaborative hiring easy and secure. With the team management feature, employers can invite colleagues, recruiters, or HR staff to join their company account and assign them specific roles and permissions.

## Team Creation and Management

Employers can add multiple team members to their organization. Each team member receives an invitation to join the employer's workspace on Hiregen. Once accepted, they can log in and access the employer panel according to the permissions granted.

This permission-based access ensures that sensitive information and critical actions are only available to authorized users, enhancing security and accountability within the hiring process.

## Benefits

- **Collaboration:** Multiple team members can work together on hiring tasks, improving efficiency.
- **Security:** Role-based permissions prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Flexibility:** Employers can easily update team composition and permissions as their organization grows.
